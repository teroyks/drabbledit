# Drabble Editor

A simple drabble editor in the browser â€“ very much an alpha version.

## Roadmap

1. ~~Fix editor size on word wrap.~~
2. Automatically remove default title on change.
3. Ignore subheadings in word count.
4. Mobile: editor field size.
5. Mobile: sticky header.
6. Drabble preview.
7. Mark words over max length in editor.
