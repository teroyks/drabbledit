A simple drabble editor in the browser â€“ very much an alpha version.

2. ~~Automatically remove default title on change.~~
3. Export/email (preview?)
3. ignore non-words
3. Correctly handle non-breaking space in wordcount 
3. Smartypants-style smart quotes
3. Ignore subheadings in word count.
4. Mobile: editor field size.
5. Mobile: sticky header.
6. Move cursor to the end of field content on focus.
7. Set focus to text field on load if title is different from default.
8. Drabble preview.
9. Mark words over max length in editor.
10. Maybe use XState for handling title states?
